# Contrax Contract Testing ðŸ§ªðŸ§ªðŸ§ª

## Existing Tests
- Liquidity pool tests
- Single sided tests
  
## Running Tests

Tests can be run with the following:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

To run the tests with a persistent state, you can change networks through inspecting MetaMask or run the following:

```shell
npx hardhat node
```

...and in another terminal window:

```shell
npx hardhat test --network localhost
npx hardhat console --network localhost
```

## Tests on Deployed Contracts

Many of the existing tests are running on already deployed contracted addresses and ABI files.

If there are valid `.sol` files in the repository, but the contracts are already deployed, use the following:

```shell
const vaultContract = await ethers.getContractAt("VaultSushiWethDai", vaultAddr,  governanceSigner);
```

Or, in their respective [LPStrats](test/LPStrats), be sure to specify the vault address:

```
vaultAddress: <vault address>
```

## Tests on New Strategies

To simulate the deployment of a new strategy, use the following:

```
const stratFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("StrategySushiWethDai");
const deployedStrat = await stratFactory.deploy(governanceAddr, strategistAddr, controllerAddr, timelockAddr);
```

Or, in their respective [LPStrats](test/LPStrats), be sure to specify the name and controller:

```shell 
name: "SushiWethDai",
controller: "sushi"
```

This code will create a factory, and through `deploy()` create an instance of that contract.

## Finding token slots

These tests use hardhat's overwrite functionality to give accounts token balances. To accomplish this,
we need to specify which memory slot to overwrite in the token's contract on the forked chain. 

[Install Slot20 CLI app](https://github.com/kendricktan/slot20)

After the above is installed, complete the following
1) Run a local hardhat instance `npx hardhat node`
2) call `slot20 balanceOf {contract_addr} {balance_holder_addr} -v` 
e.g. ![alt text](slotExample.png "Logo Title Text 1")
3) Add slot number to helpers::findSlot() function 

N.B If you are getting errors make sure you are pointing to a full archive node in the RPC address. 

N.N.B. If you are finding it hard to find an account with active balance of said token, you can always use a few dollars worth of real money to acquire token and restart the hardhat node.
